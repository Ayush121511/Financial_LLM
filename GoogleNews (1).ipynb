              "'\\nRelated Stories\\nIn October 2023, Nick Volkov came across a unique listing for a house and just knew he had to show it to his girlfriend,Jenna Phipps, a 28-year-old content creator.\\nThough the listing included pictures of the exterior only and described the house as a \"tear-down,\" the 27-year-old program manager tells CNBC Make It that what stood out the most about the property in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, was that it was undervalued, had a water view, and wasn\\'t a standard modern house.\\nPhipps says she fell in love with the property and knew they had to go see it immediately, but \"when we finally got to see the house [in person], we saw it was a lot worse.\"\\n\"There was a reason they didn\\'t show photos of the inside,\" she says.\\nThe property in question is a 2,757-square-foot single-family home built in 1961. It has three bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms, a pool, and 0.30 acres of land.\\nThe house was so dilapidated that the realtor had the couple sign a waiver before entering.\\n\"You can really see this property had not been cared for at all,\" Volkov says. \"Once you got inside, there was a really musky smell with the old furniture and old things there.\"\\nStill, they were able to find some beauty in the space: \"The architecture showed through all of that. You could see what it was in its former days,\" Volkov says. \"Even with it half falling apart, it was still really pretty.\"\\nOne of the most significant issues the couple encountered immediately was that the roof needed to be replaced. Other issues included completely overgrown landscaping, mold throughout, and high levels of moisture from all the water that had come into the house over the years.\\nDespite all the flaws, Phipps knew she and Volkov had found their forever home.\\n\"I think the biggest thing that stood out to me was the architecture of the home because mid-century modern homes are so rare for the area,\" she said. \"We looked past how bad it was because we knew that we could really transform it ourselves. This house has so much potential and we felt very special to be the people to see that.\"\\nThe couple decided to make an offer.\\nThe house was valued at $3.4 million CAD or $2.5 million USD with an asking price of $2.6 million CAD or $1.9 million USD.\\nBecause of the property\\'s condition, Volkov and Phipps could not get a traditional mortgage and had to opt for a private two-year loan instead.\\nThe couple met with the seller and shared their plans to restore the home instead of tearing it down. The seller then agreed to their bid of $2.1 million CAD or $1,525,923 USD.\\nThe median list price of homes in Vancouver, BC, overall was $1,578,540 in March 2024, according toHouseful, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Canada.\\nThe couple split the 20% down payment evenly.\\n\"People were very shocked at how we were able to get that price, especially in that area,\" Phipps says. \"We kind of bought the worst thing in a great neighborhood.\"\\nPhipps and Volkov agree that, for them, landing in their desired neighborhood means they got a pretty good deal.\\nThe couple plans to use the two years they have to repay their private loan to fix up the house as much as possible and then refinance to get a traditional mortgage.\\nWhen the two took possession of the home, it had been empty for four years, the couple said. A family built it in the 1960s, and then it was passed down to two siblings, a son and a daughter. The son, an architect, lived in the home for many years, and then, when he passed away, the house went to his sister, who then sold it to Phipps and Volkov.\\nBecause the seller lived several hours away, she would rarely visit, which is why the property was so deteriorated, the couple says.\\n\"It was in a state that probably no one should have lived there,\" Phipps says. \"She would come to visit and take things out, but no one lived there for years.\"\\nThe couple closed in January 2024 and started the clearing-out process immediately. The first step was to put tarps all over the roof to ensure no more water or moisture entered the house.\\n\"It was a very eventful first weekend of just trying to maintain what the house looked liked and not letting it get worse,\" Phipps says.\\nWhile cleaning out the home, they found some of the original furniture, old photos of what the house looked like before, and a record player that was hooked up to speakers all over the house. Volkov found that discovery pretty exciting.\\n\"Imagine having a house back in the day and you could play music everywhere in it from a record player,\" he says. \"The record player was still there when we bought the house, so that was really cool.\"\\nThere was a lot of mold and potentially hazardous areas in the house, that the couple tackled themselves. The two bought full-face gas masks and got to work. It was also a way for them to save money.\\nAfter several months of cleaning, the two enlisted their parents\\' help to get it down to the studs. Now, the couple is working with an engineer to get a new roof on before winter starts this year and has shifted to clearing out the house\\'s grounds.\\n\"The property was very overgrown, and unfortunately, a lot of the greenery will have to be taken out,\" Phipps says.\\nThe couple plans to keep as much of the house\\'s original design as possible. They are still in the process of getting the permits they need to start construction.\\nVolkov and Phipps plan to keep the mid-century modern look and feel for the exterior with modern appliances and features throughout the house inside.\\nTo date, the couple estimates they have invested $10,000 CAD and hopes to keep the full renovation under $300,000 CAD.\\n\"Over the next two years, we\\'re putting everything we have into the home and living the frugal lifestyle,\" Phipps says.\\nThey plan to do much of the work themselves and will split the costs, with Volkov paying off the private loan and Phipps paying for all the renovation expenses.\\n\"We decided to do that to keep the flow going and help keep costs down,\" Volkov says. \"The really fun part of it all is that you get to witness every stage of the construction.\"\\nConversions to USD were done on April 19, 2024, using OANDA conversion rates of 1 CAD to 0.73 USD. All amounts are rounded to the nearest dollar.\\nWant to make extra money outside of your day job?Sign up forCNBC\\'s new online course How to Earn Passive Income Onlineto learn about common passive income streams, tips to get started and real-life success stories.

              "'\\nRelated Stories\\nThis story is part of CNBC Make It\\'sMillennial Moneyseries, which details how people around the world earn, spend and save their money.\\nShonnita Leslie always had a passion for education. But by the time she earned her bachelor\\'s degree in sociology and master\\'s of education in psychology with a concentration in school counseling in 2009, her student loan debt had ballooned to around $101,000 and she was struggling to make payments.\\n\"Because I graduated during the Great Recession, it was really hard for me to get on my feet and find my first stable job working full-time to make enough to even pay the minimum,\" she tells CNBC Make It.\\nLeslie was eventually able to find work as a certified school counselor at a public school in Connecticut, where she\\'s from, earning enough to make her minimum student loan payments.\\nHowever, she wanted to be able to pay off her debt more quickly. She ended up moving to Houston, Texas, where she earns $65,000 between her full-time role as a program manager at a university, and part-time work as a DoorDash driver and freelance writer.\\n\"I was welcomed with open arms here in Houston,\" she says. \"I absolutely love it here.\"\\nHere\\'s how she balances multiple jobs while continuing to pay down her student loans.\\nGrowing up in Connecticut, Leslie was surrounded by family members who were educators, which influenced her to pursue a career in the field.\\nHowever, she didn\\'t factor in how much she would be able to earn working in education, compared with the student loan debt she would need to take on in order to gain the proper credentials, she says.\\n\"I was always following my passion instead of really thinking logically about the career field versus the income,\" she says. \"Education is one of those few fields where you need a high level of education versus the amount of money that you will be compensated for.\"\\nAlthough Leslie has been chipping away at her student loan debt for about 15 years, she says it\\'s been worth it in order to pursue her passion.\\n\"This is the work that I love,\" she says. \"I love giving people information that I didn\\'t have.\"\\nAt the end of the 2017 school year, Leslie\\'s district underwent massive layoffs and her school ended up closing, prompting her to move to Houston. She had family in Texas and knew the cost of living would be cheaper than in Connecticut.\\nShe initially landed a job at a charter school. A year later, she was offered a job as a program manager at a university, which she still holds today. She continued repaying her student loans, but her payments only went toward the accumulated interest. Despite making consistent payments, her principal balance remained at $101,000.\\nLuckily, Leslie\\'s years as a school counselor had set her on track to qualify forPublic Service Loan Forgiveness, and continuing to work in public education put her even closer every year.\\nIn 2022, she finally had $60,000 in federal loans forgiven through the PSLF program. \"I was completely relieved,\" she says.\\nHowever, since Leslie had private student loans that didn\\'t qualify for forgiveness, she still had a balance of around $40,000, so she decided to pick up a part-time job as a DoorDash delivery driver.\\n\"I just wasn\\'t making enough money to make a dent in my debt and I knew I could do it a lot quicker if I had something like DoorDash to help compensate my full-time earnings,\" she says.\\nOver the course of five years, from 2018 to 2023, Leslie earned around $72,000 total working part-time as a DoorDash delivery driver.\\nShe initially bought a certified preowned car to make deliveries, but it came with even more debt. Leslie used her early DoorDash earnings to eliminate her car loan, then began throwing the rest at her remaining student loan balance.\\nThe amount she earns each year depends on how many hours she worked. When she began in 2018, she earned around $6,324. By the next year, she had more than doubled her earnings to nearly $18,000.\\nLeslie usually makes deliveries after work on weekdays, and enjoys being able to use the flexible hours to her advantage. At one point, she was working an average of 30 hours a week through DoorDash in addition to her full-time job. Currently, she only spends about five hours a week on the side hustle.\\nDON\\'T MISS:The ultimate guide to earning passive income online\\nBut Leslie\\'s hard work has paid off. As of 2024, she has whittled down her remaining balance to around $18,000.\\n\"It was really important that I got a lot of my student loan debt taken care of because then I was able to dedicate that back into myself and my health and my mental wellness,\" she says.\\nBy 2023, Leslie\\'s car was experiencing significant mechanical issues. One night, it almost caused her to be stranded while making a delivery.\\nLeslie decided to sell it and use the money to buy an electric bike, which she now uses to get to work and make deliveries.\\n\"I intentionally did not decide to buy a new car,\" she says. \"I had pretty much covered a lot of my debt that I wanted to pay off anyways, so it was a really great time to just kind of move on and not have a car.\"\\nPlus, she says not having a car saves her money due to not needing to pay for parking, car insurance and other related expenses.\\n\"Getting around Houston has been actually pretty easy,\" she says. \"When I\\'m going to the grocery store, for example, I can put all my groceries in my saddlebags and that kind of takes care of everything. It\\'s also really great to use the metro rail line.\"\\nHere\\'s how Leslie spent her money in February 2024.\\nLeslie uses the zero-sum budgeting strategy to manage her money, which means she assigns every dollar of her paycheck toward her various expenses.\\n\"I allocate every single dollar until it hits zero so that I understand where every expense came from,\" she says.\\nShe makes sure to factor splurges into her budget as well, such as buying workout clothing from GymShark.\\n\"Even if you\\'re still paying off debt, you still have to have some level of a lifestyle,\" she says. \"I do enjoy making sure that I have proper workout clothes and like to make sure I\\'m looking presentable.\"\\nOne financial tool Leslie doesn\\'t use is credit cards. Although when used responsibly, credit cards can help you build up your credit score and earn perks like travel rewards, she wants to avoid taking on any more debt while she focuses on paying down her student loans.\\n\"I could always get into more debt if I want more debt,\" she says. \"In the meantime, my focus [is on] the debt that I currently have.\"\\nLeslie has around $1,000 in savings, which she says is enough to cover any unexpected expense that may arise. \"I haven\\'t really needed to build a larger emergency fund yet because my liabilities are so low at the moment and I have insurance,\" she says.\\nShe also has around $96,000 saved for retirement between her 403(b) plan and Roth IRA.\\nAlthough Leslie says her student loan debt is at a more manageable level, she plans to continue working part-time as a DoorDash delivery driver for now.\\n\"I don\\'t have to do it,\" she says. \"I like having the appeal of having multiple streams of income.\"\\nShe also started her own small business,Noir in Color, where she offers her freelance writing services on topics like personal finance and side hustle ideas.\\nShe knows she\\'ll eventually want to own a home that she could rent out. However, she says she prefers renting for now because it\\'s cheaper. After she pays down her student loans, she plans to work on boosting her credit to qualify for the best terms on a mortgage.\\n\"I felt it was also essential that I continue to rent for right now until I\\'m able to feel comfortable enough to want to take on a large amount of debt all over again,\" she says.\\nUltimately, Leslie looks forward to one day clearing her debt and spending her time as she pleases.\\n\"My version of the American dream is just to be debt-free and live life on my own terms,\" she says.\\nWhat\\'s your budget breakdown?Share your story with usfor a chance to be featured in a future installment.\\nWant to make extra money outside of your day job?Sign up for CNBC\\'s new online courseHow to Earn Passive Income Onlineto learn about common passive income streams, tips to get started and real-life success stories.
